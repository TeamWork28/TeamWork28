<h4>Tips for learning</h4>
- I love reading and I learnt some of them while reading only. So I suggest this (https://www.w3schools.com/) To learn anything you want.<br>
- If you can understand documentation go for it, else prefer practical go for Youtube 
- For more advanced version for learning from videos and blogs I suggest (https://www.udemy.com/), You can buy courses for less price when available and learn from it. NOT RECOMMENDING<br>
- Happy coding.
