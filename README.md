<h3>Tips for learning</h3>
- I love reading and I learnt some of them while reading only. So I suggest this (https://www.w3schools.com/) To learn anything you want.
- For Video learners I suggest you guys to see (https://www.youtube.com/@freecodecamp & https://www.youtube.com/@abdul_bari) You can learn Python and Java with them at free of cost.
- For more advanced version for learning from videos and blogs I suggest (https://www.udemy.com/), You can buy courses for less price when available and learn from it.
- Happy coding.
